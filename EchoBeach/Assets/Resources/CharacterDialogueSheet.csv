Ella Nella;Hello! Welcome to the retro-pop zone. We welcome all kinds of music lovers and musicians, but particularly enjoy the sounds of the retro-revolution 2005-25. Basic rules are just be kind and feel free to share your work. Please try and be discrete and stick to pseudonyms. We haven't had any problems yet, but you never know. Ella.;Happy Belated Birthday Grey! You know mine is just a month before? Anyway, lots of happy returns. I know things have been tough recently, but I wanted to let you know how valued you are in the community and how great your music is.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
CuckooSong;Hi all, lovely to meet you, I'm Cuckoo (my friends call me Camille). Look forward to getting to know you.;So, here in no particular order are my favourite retro artists. First has to be the Arctic Monkeys (their lounge stuff, not the rawk). Love that Alex Turner, hmmm dreamy. Secondly I love some more Americana stuff, I really like Bright Eyes, Sufjan, Fleet all the hipsters. Finally I'm really into this super little known band called Pony Parade, they made like one record. It's from the 90s, anyone know it?;Favourite songs, I'm thinking first the classics - Life on Mars, All The Young Dudes, ah Bowie. Anything by Alanis, retro pop - Charlie XCX (sensing a bit of that there Ella, Boom Clap perhaps?), Katie Perry, Taylor. I like thoughtful lyrics and big tunes.;So today I've been thinking a lot about those lines in Sweet Jane by The Velvet Underground, 'Jack, he is a banker. And Jane, she is a clerk. And both of them save their moneys. When they come home from work'. Are we meant to laugh at them or feel for them?;Nice one Blantano. I only recently discovered Lou Reed at the black market record fair. Sometimes makes me feel sooo boring, which I am. I'm more President Trump than President Musk.;So I've been writing a little recently and I have something special to show you! I hope you enjoy it!;Thanks guys, it means a lot to me!;NO POST TODAY
FuturePerfect;I'd love a mentor, someone to teach me. There seems to be some great older mentors with students on the web - Elvis & BabyBell, Rick and Felt, even Curt and Adrian. I think I'd learn so much from an old fashioned master apprenticeship.;So here's a question, if all the schools are teaching is how to be a citizen, what sort of basis do my students have in history, politics, economics? It's just plain dogma.;I've been getting a lot of lip from my students recently, who want to know why the power keeps getting turned off. Obviously nothing I can do, Grey, what do you do in your classroom when there's trouble? You're a big lad, menace them?;Hey Sunburnt, you been shovelling snow?;Thinking of you Cuckoo…;NO POST TODAY;Jesus, where is everyone? It's like a graveyard here.;Hey 12 Tone, I know you say you got your moniker because your name is the same as the inventor of 12 tone music, but I know you...and you're not called Arnold. What's the deal?
DaveyMoon;Recently I've been listening a lot to Ella Nella's new work. Honestly, I do think she's the most sensational pop musician - voice, writing, everything. We've been talking about doing a collaboration. I've got this drum machine that's been doing the rounds - the one with the dual sounds, you know it. I think it would be perfect for something more mid-tempo for Ella to scream over.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Lady Jane (Elsie Bristol);A good stage name, that's the key for me. I've never used my own name (sorry all Janes out there), unlike my friend Davey. To me, a stage name is like an identity that you can throw on whenever it suits you. In real life I'm not that confident, but Lady Jane can step out in front of all you boys and girls and let 'em have it.;NO POST TODAY;I've always been pretty proud of my roots, in fact my surname is the largest city in my county. I think because of that I've always had a strong connection to my location and I try to write about it as much as possible. People call me Hazelnut (or variations) because of my hair, not much to say about that. Hey BS, how do you write your stuff?;I've been living alone since my brother was called up to the Navy. Seems like every young man is guarding the perimeter, waiting for something to happen. I'm here wondering when things are going to start changing. All that keeps me going is this board and people on it. I hope you know how much it means to me.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Smoking Elvis;Copying is a big thing for me, I can't see the point. I always used to disagree with Gwilym over how he'd write songs with same title as his favourite artists. I'd say, you're not Neil Young, why not do something else. I think he found it a good springboard for creativity.;I've been living with my girlfriend, the lovely Ella Nella, for like six months now. We're really enjoying it, despite the clouds of black ash that rain down every night from the cement factories. Lots of music, lots of dope, lots of pirated Dustin Hoffman films, fuck the censors! Anyway, she's been thinking of taking in this stray cat we've seen around the neighbourhood. Thing only has three legs, what do you think? I mean, is it me, do you think? Do I look like a Cat lover to you?;Hey guys, some stuff has come up which you might not know about. Something pretty shocking, I can't talk about it in case it endangers anyone here, but I'm going to be taking sometime off the board. I don't know how it happened, but I hope you're all safe. Elvis.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Simple Simon;Wanted to take a moment to tell you about my dear friend Davey Moon. Davey is a super lad, who at the age of four was so prodigious on the Ukulele, he was taken to see the Lord Mayor. I've played with Davey (nee. Pritchard) for a number of years on different projects and I can say he's an ace on guitar, bass and drums. Top Bloke!;Tried some proper Rooibos tea for the first time at Elvis's yesterday. Very tasty. I must come round Studebaker Mansions more often. Look at me up in the Mansion!;When I'm able to drag myself away from the piano, I'm always drawn to the writing of Oodles. You know, there's very few writers on here who make me think quite as hard as him. Honestly, I know some people think him a bit niche, but he's got it covered.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Boyfriend Sweater;This is my Taylor song. I guess you could call me a bit of a shapeshifter, but that's the way I like it. You know, a lot of people talk about having their own style, but for me being a fan and being a musician are the same thing. I just love to get going with an impression and see where it takes me. For this, I'm thinking post-Folklore, 2023ish, just before the motorcycle crash that killed Harry Styles. It's for someone who was special at the time.;Hey Elsie (or 'Nutty', whatever you prefer), give me a ping, I need to chat with you about how incredible you are! So authentic.;I love HAIM, totally unique to their era. Not so unique to others perhaps, but hey ho.;How do I write my stuff? Well, generally I sit down with the drum or chord machines and get a little cycle going. Most of my songs are like four chords in a loop. Then I just jam around over the top. I've been using a lot of the shimmer machine, which everyone seems to have borrowed by now. Just a thief I guess!;NO POST TODAY;//;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
SGTT;//;//;I guess this song was pretty much my attempt at Phoebe (the last great female indie star imo). I've never been to LA, but I wanted to convey some of the things they talk about in all those great songs by Elliott, Phoebe, Julien - feeling lonely, lost. I think it's something we can all relate to.;Yeah Adrian, I dunno. I think mentioning an ex-partner by name is a pretty bold move. I'm not sure I'd do it, but hey, what a song! 'Roads on the County Lines'...;NO POST TODAY;Yeah, I guess I just find Angel a bit too abrasive for me sometimes. I like things nice and mellow and miserable...Happy to chat about it, I'll message.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Grey Gardner;//;//;Hey guys, hope you're all keeping well. I'm keeping the drum machine for the moment, I'll move it on to the next in line tomorrow, which I believe is SGTT.;Jeez, I hope Elvis is OK.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Blantano;//;//;Record Review: Overcoat by Sunburnt County. A poignant song in the style of Smog, Bill Callahan and Tindersticks. Well worth a listen.;Hey Cuckoo, good question about Sweet Jane. Obviously they're the man, but at the same time they're not hurting anybody. It's just most people are straight, especially these days. Let Jack and Jane have their fun, plus you never know they may be musicians on the quiet as well. As long as I've got Transformer to keep me warm. Love me some Lou Reed.;Record Review: River by Lady Jane. Ever the versatile bedroom producer (as we all are now), Lady Jane fashions a stylish rhythm section from sticks, claps and a drum machine. Her electro-acoustic approach manages to sound precise yet organic at the same time, cool like the Ice floats, but warm like the sun.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
BabyBell;//;//;Hey BP, I know it's someone else's, but you wrote that song right? Love the chorus - 'It might be a second away', Stones reference?;NO POST TODAY;Poll: Best Neil Young Album and Year: Smoking Elvis, After The Goldrush, 1970, Blantano, Trans, 1982. Adrian - 1992, you know the record, look it up.;Hey Buried Pleasures, great song you wrote for…(can I say?). Mentioned your old road in the American quarter in it eh? God I miss travel.;Does anybody have an ID where the date is actually impossible?;NO POST TODAY
Girlfriend Smirlfriend;//;//;//;You put my name in a song? The sheer nerve! Did people really say it was a nothing crush, I sure didn't!;Anyone heard from Davey recently? He's not responding to my DMs.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Sunburnt County;//;//;//;Yeah Future, in my mind perhaps...;So I wrote and recorded a new song. I wanted to talk about some snowy, romantic escapade (and a lost coat).;I hate to say it, but sometimes I look around the board and wonder where all the 'alternative' music went. I mean, this isn't a Jack Antonoff love in. Haven't you guys ever heard of Bill Callahan?;I sometimes go down the French quarter to see the road signs. They're all named after famous French composers. Ah yes, our flirtation with globalism before it all went to shit and we closed in on ourselves. Still, we'll always have Paris...;NO POST TODAY
VileyCurt;//;//;//;Our Simple Simon has always been obsessed with everything lunar. He once told me it came from working at night as a porter. Lots of time, lots of stargazing…Love our Simon, even if he does sound like Coldplay :);You know I try to write about where I'm from, but you know, New Dulwich is pretty boring. I wish I could talk about London the way Lady Jane talks about County Avon.;Nice one Collier, funnily enough, the day and month of mine is the time signature. And well done Cuckoo. Best.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Adrian (Gwilym);//;//;//;You've always got to be careful with talking about people's romantic partners on the site. I've certainly found it awkward in the past, but hey, art is art and you need to discuss it! I'm sure that Smirlfriend wishes Boyfriend Sweater all the best, even if they're not together anymore.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Oodles of Poodles;//;//;//;So I've got a new article on the retro revolution of 2005. I can't stick it all here (DM me), but I'll be posting up excerpts over the next few days...;The Arctic Monkeys. Despite his scrawny frame and yowling singing voice, Alex Turner possessed a quick and subtle lyrical wit akin to Ray Davies of the Kinks or Chris Difford of Squeeze. He seemed to draw a straight line back to the disaffected popular singers of the 60s, from Roger Daltrey to Scott Walker.;The Killers were in many ways a new old band. Like many of their contemporaries they wore their influences on their sleeve. A smattering of New Order, a brush with the Smiths and The Human League. What set them apart was their commitment to melodicism over macho posturing. At a time full of yowling bands like the Hives, The Vines and other definite articles, The Killers produced shameless pop. Although the Hives were pretty good actually. Their later turn towards Heartland Rock notwithstanding, The Killers represent the melodic high water mark of the era.;Jack White of The White Stripes was perhaps the last frontman of a major rock group who managed to cultivate any significant mystique around himself. Divorced from the rich boy gravitas of Julian Casablancas, or the hillbilly posturing of Kings of Leon, White presented a figure utterly inscrutable. There was no clear distinction where performance and artist began or ended. In this sense, his closest musical forebear appeared to be Nick Cave, another progressive bluesman of sorts.;Looks like this party may be coming to an end. Here's one last bit. I was very young when I experienced the music I write about and it has left and indelible mark on me. Looking back has always been a way to look forward, but in these times I wonder if it is all we have left. Alex, Jack, Franz, and all those other good looking bastards.
Danzig Ostrifier;//;//;//;I'm a writer, but I feel like I am more than that...;Jesus Oodles, how do you find it so easy to write?;Music journalism is one thing, but I've always found it strange that people don't consider you a musician. Lester Bangs was one! Sort of. Nothing I like more than sitting down with my chord machine and working out other people's songs.;Um...;What is the role of cultural journalism in a time when culture is banned? Is it to be a historian, a curator, a keeper of the flame? I say, absolutely not. Culture never disappears, no matter the circumstances. We must seek it out and let it flourish, whatever the costs. Culture is not always in the museum (before they became homages to state politics), but it will not die and it is for us to be with it.
A Felt Mountain;//;//;//;NO POST TODAY;Adrian/Blantano's Delta is like if Elliott Smith wrote Karma Police. Like a lot of us, he's been using that Cimbalom machine to get those chimey 'Third Man' sounds. An awesome, moody piece of writing with a Lennonish vocal.;I frickin love Cuckoo's new song, what a trip. I love the whole psychedelic, laidback feel. Harmonically, it's super interesting. The way those first two chords move from the SubDominant to the Tonic is you know, fairly established, but so effective. The rhythms in common time meter are flexible and spacey. Can't wait to see what they do next.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Buried Pleasures;//;//;//;//;NO POST TODAY;Pretty happy with a song I wrote for an artist here. Used the drum machine (acoustic setting), you might recognise the sound. Something like 67 bpm.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Chuck & Steven;//;//;//;//;Outdated tech. Who doesn't love it? We'll be discussing vinyl, CDs, VHS, The Commodore 64, all the good stuff! Although pretty much all contraband now, you can find a good selection on the black market in the German quarter. where we have been know to run a stall.;Now in our overview of outdated technologies we come to CDs. CDs were pretty pricey and not as good as vinyl, but you could do some nifty things with them. For example, you could make it so the track started a little later than zero and so you could rewind for a secret track. Great use of technology!;Betamax was perhaps the technology that never was. Although superior in many ways to VHS, they simply couldn't corner the market. Proof, if it were ever needed, that convenience trumps quality.;Seems like our posts have outlasted most of the board. Oh well, let's see how long we can keep this going shall we. This week, it's time for the great grandaddy of them all, ham radio. Ham has become in recent years the main go to day-to-day communication device for scofflaws such as ourselves. We use it to keep up with brethren in their own regimes across the world. Truly an old dog that learnt new tricks, Ham has proved invaluable where closed computer networks are not possible.
Unleashed Collier;//;//;//;//;//;So here's something interesting, the first two chords of Cuckoo's song are actually the day and month of my birthday (in that order). Funny how the universe turns.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
12 Tone Moan;//;//;//;//;//;A lot of us actually live pretty close to each other in the French Quarter. I often see Rick and Felt going to their work together. It's a pretty cosy community of illegals, nere' do wells and general flagrant disregarders.;Great stuff Cuckoo, sorry I'm late to the party.;Heya Future, that's because Schoenberg didn't invent it, he just built on it. Best.
Cornell's Kernels;//;//;//;//;//;Favourite Romantic Era Composers : Satie, Ravel, Chopin, Beethoven, Brahms. Nuff Said.;Hi Babybell, yes I do! Comes in useful all the time! Especially on leap, leap, leap years.;NO POST TODAY
Mealy Adam;//;//;//;//;//;You ever tried 16/17 time signature? What a great meter! Sure beats common time 4/4.;Nice one Cuckoosong, stick it up for everyone and I'll be sure to give you compliments (and a harmonic analysis!);Been listening to ThinkTank, by Blur. Great secret track before track one (love how they're making a comeback), check it out.
The Shit Parade;//;//;//;//;//;Hey SGTT, you into Angel Olsen?;Hey guys I've got something to say. Coming soon.;Ye know, it makes me sick how SGTT is being treated. She's totally in love with Sunburnt (and never stops to say it), but he is totally on one with someone else on the board. Sorry I had to be the one to say it but respect is so important.
Slick Rick;//;//;//;//;//;Call me an old guy, but I say there's no HAIM without Fleetwood Mac, no Lorde without Kate Bush. You guys are all into that mid-2000s stuff, but I say go deeper! I mean, just look at the production - cocaine, booze and 8 tracks, what more could you ask for!;Today I wanted to talk about the 'Mu' chord. Associated with Steely Dan, it's a major chord with an added 9. It's got a bright sparkly sound you can hear on all sorts of things all the way to the Smiths. The 9th in the 2000s also started to become a strong note to lead a chorus with. You can even hear it on our chameleon-par-excellence Ella Nella's new track.;NO POST TODAY
