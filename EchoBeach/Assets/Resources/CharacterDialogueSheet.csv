Ella Nella;Hello! Welcome to the retro-pop zone. We welcome all kinds of music lovers and musicians, but particularly enjoy the sounds of the retro-revolution 2005-25. Basic rules are just be kind and feel free to share your work. Please try and be discrete and stick to pseudonyms. We haven't had any problems yet, but you never know. Ella.;Happy Belated Birthday Grey! You know mine is just a month before? Anyway, lots of happy returns. I know things have been tough recently, but I wanted to let you know how valued you are in the community and how great your music is.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
CuckooSong;Hi all, lovely to meet you, I'm Cuckoo (my friends call me Camille). Look forward to getting to know you.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;So I've been writing a little recently, can't wait to show you.;Thanks guys, it means a lot to me!
FuturePerfect;I'd love a mentor, someone to teach me. There seems to be some great older mentors with students on the web - Elvis & BabyBell, Rick and Felt, even Curt and Adrian. I think I'd learn so much from and old fashioned master apprenticeship.;So here's a question, if all the schools are teaching is how to be a citizen, what sort of basis do my students have in history, politics, economics? It's just plain dogma.;I've been getting a lot of lip from my students recently, who want to know why the power keeps getting turned off. Obviously nothing I can do, Grey, what do you do in your classroom when there's trouble? You're a big lad, menace them?;Hey Sunburnt, you been shovelling snow?;NO POST TODAY;Thinking of you Cuckoo;Jesus, where is everyone? It's like a graveyard here.;Hey 12 Tone, I know you say you got your moniker because your name is the same as the inventor of 12 tone music, but I know you...and you're not called Arnold. What's the deal?
DaveyMoon;Recently I've been listening a lot to Ella Nella's new work. Honestly, I do think she's the most sensational pop musician - voice, writing, everything. We've been talking about doing a collaboration. I've got this drum machine that's been doing the rounds - the one with the fixed tempo, you know it. I think it would be perfect for something more mid-tempo for Ella to scream over.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Lady Jane (Elsie Bristol);A good stage name, that's the key for me. I've never used my own name (sorry all Janes out there), unlike my friend Davey. To me, a stage name is like an identity that you can throw on whenever it suits you. In real life I'm not that confident, but Lady Jane can step out in front of all you boys and girls and let 'em have it.;NO POST TODAY;I've always been pretty proud of my roots, in fact my surname is the largest city in my county. I think because of that I've always had a strong connection to my location and I try to write about it as much as possible. People call me Hazelnut because of my hair, not much to say about that. Hey BS, how do you write your stuff?;I've been living alone since my brother was called up to the Navy. Seems like every young man is guarding the perimeter, waiting for something to happen. I'm here wondering when things are going to start changing. All that keeps me going is this board and people on it. I hope you know how much it means to me.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Smoking Elvis;Copying is a big thing for me, I can't see the point. I always used to disagree with Gwilym over how he'd write songs with same title as his favorite artists. I'd say, you're not Neil Young, why not do something else. I think he found it a good springboard for creativity.;I've been living with my girlfriend, the lovely Ella Nella, for like six months now. We're really enjoying it, despite the clouds of black ash that rain down every night from the cement factories. Lots of music, lots of dope, lots of pirated Dustin Hoffman films, fuck the censors! Anyway, she's been thinking of taking in this stray cat we've seen around the neighbourhood. Thing only has three legs, what do you think? I mean, is it me, do you think? Do I look like a Cat lover to you?;Hey guys, some stuff has come up which you might not know about. Something pretty shocking, I can't talk about it in case it endangers anyone here, but I'm going to be taking sometime off the board. I don't know how it happened, but I hope you're all safe. Elvis.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Simple Simon;Wanted to take a moment to tell you about my dear friend Davey Moon. Davey is a super lad, who at the age of four was so prodigious on the Ukulele, he was taken to see the Lord Mayor. I've played with Davey ((nee. Pritchard) for a number of years on different projects and I can say he's an ace on guitar, bass and drums. Top Bloke!;Tried some proper Rooibos tea for the first at Elvis's yesterday. Very tasty. I must come round Studebaker Mansions more often. Look at me up in the Mansion!;When I'm able to drag myself away from the piano, I'm always drawn to the writing of Danzig. You know, there's very few writers on here who make me think quite as hard as him. Honestly, I know some people think him a bit austere, but he's got it covered.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Boyfriend Sweater;This is my Taylor thing. I guess you could call me a bit of shapeshifter, but that's the way I like it. You know, a lot of people talk about having their own style, but for me being a fan and being a musician are the same thing. I just love to get going with an impression and see where it takes me. For this, I'm thinking post-Folklore, 2023ish, just before the car crash that killed Harry Styles.;Hey Elsie (the call you Hazelnut, right), give me ping, I need to chat with you about how incredible you are! So authentic.;I love HAIM, totally unique to their era. Not so unique to others perhaps, but hey ho.;How do I write my stuff? Well, generally I sit down with the drum or chord machines and get a little cycle going. Most of my songs are like four chords in a loop. Then I just jam around over the top. I've been using a lot of the shimmer machine, which everyone seems to have borrowed by now. Just a thief I guess!;NO POST TODAY;//;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
SGTT;//;//;I guess this song was pretty much my attempt at Phoebe (the last great Female indie star imo). I've never been to LA, but I wanted to convey some of the things they talk about in all those great songs by Elliott, Phoebe, Julien - feeling lonely, lost. I think it's something we can all relate to.;"Yeah Adrian, I dunno. I think mentioning an ex-partner by name is a pretty bold more. I'm not sure I'd do it, but hey, what a song! ""Roads on the County Lines""...";NO POST TODAY;Yeah, I guess I just find Angel a bit too abrasive for me sometimes. I like things nice and mellow and miserable...Happy to chat about it, I'll message.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Grey Gardner;//;//;Hey guys, hope you're all keeping well. I'm keeping the drum machine for the moment, I'll move it on to the next in line tomorrow, which I believe is SGTT.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Blantano;//;//;Record Review: OverCoat by Sunburnt County. A poignant song in the style of Smog, Bill Callahan and Tindersticks. Well worth a listen.;NO POST TODAY;Record Review: River by Lady Jane. Ever the versatile bedroom producer (as we all are now), Lady Jane fashions a stylish rhythm section from sticks, claps and a drum machine. Her electro-acoustic approach manages to sound precise yet organic at the same time, cool like the Ice floats, but warm like the sun.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
BabyBell;//;//;Hey BP, I know it's someone elses, but you wrote that song right? Love the chorus - 'It might be a second away', Stones reference?;NO POST TODAY;Poll: Best Neil Young Album and Year: Smoking Elvis, After The Goldrush, 1970, Blantano, Trans, 1982. Adrian - 1992, you know the record, look it up.;Hey great song you wrote Buried Pleasures, named it after your old road in the American quarter eh? God I miss travel.;Does anybody have an ID where the date is actually impossible?;NO POST TODAY
Girlfriend Smirlfriend;//;//;//;Name a song after me, the sheer nerve. Did people really say it was a nothing crush, I sure didn't!;Anyone heard from Davey recently? He's not responding to my DMs.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Sunburnt County;//;//;//;Yeah Future, in my mind perhaps...;So I wrote and recorded a new song. I wanted to talk about some snowy, romantic escapade (and a lost coat).;I hate to say it, but sometimes I look around the board and wonder where all the 'alternative' music went. I mean, this isnt a Jack Antonoff love in. Haven't you guys ever heard of Bill Callahan?;I sometimes go down the French quarter to see the road signs. They're all named after famous French composers. Ah yes, our flirtation with globalism before it all went to shit and we closed in on ourselves. Still, we'll always have Paris...;
VileyCurt;//;//;//;Our Simple Simon has always been obsessed with everything lunar. He once told me it came from working at night as a porter. Lots of time, lots of stargazing…Love our Simon, even if he does sound like Coldplay :);You know I try to write about where I'm from, but you know, New Dulwich is pretty boring. I wish I could talk about London the way Lady Jane talks about County Avon.;Nice one Collier, funnily enough, the day and month of mine is the time signature. Best.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Adrian (Gwilym);//;//;//;You've always got to be careful with talking about people's romantic partners on the site. I've certainly found it awkward in the past, but hey, art is art and you need to discuss it! I'm sure that Smirlfriend wishes Boyfriend Sweater all the best, even if they're not together anymore.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Oodles of Poodles;//;//;//;So I've got a new article o the retro revolution of 2005. I can't stick it all here (DM me), but I'll be posting up excerpts over the next few days...;The Arctic Monkeys. Despite his scrawny frame and yowling singing voice, Alex Turner possessed a quick and subtle lyrical wit akin to Ray Davies of the Kinks or Chris Difford of Squeeze. He seemed to draw a straight line back to the disaffected popular singers of the 60s, from Roger Daltrey to Scott Walker.;The Killers were in many ways a new old band. Like many of their contemporaries they wore their influences on their sleeve. A smattering of New Order, a brush with the Smiths and The Human League. What set them apart was their commitment to melodicism over macho posturing. At a time full of yowling bands likes the Hives, The Vines and other definite articles, The Killers produced shameless pop. Their later turn towards Heartland Rock notwithstanding, The Killers represent the melodic high water mark of the era.;Jack White of The White Stripes was perhaps the last frontman of a major rock group who managed to cultivate any significant mystique around himself. Divorced from the rich boy gravitas of Julian Casablancas, or the hillbilly posturing of Kings of Leon, White presented a figure utterly inscrutable. There was no clear distinction where performance and artist began or ended. In this sense, his closest musical forebear appeared to be Nick Cave, another progressive bluesman of sorts.;Looks like this party may be coming to an end. Here's one last bit. I was very young when I experienced the music I write about it and it has left and indelible mark on me. Looking back has always been a way to look forward, but in these times I wonder if it is all we have left. Alex, Jack, Franz, and all those other good looking bastards.
Danzig Ostrifier;//;//;//;I'm a writer, but I feel like I am more than that...;Jesus Oodles, how do you find it so easy to write?;Music journalism is one thing, but I've always found it strange that people don't consider you a musician. Lester Bangs was one! Sort of. Nothing I like more than sitting down with my chord machine and working out other people's songs.;Um...;What is the role of cultural journalism in a time when culture is banned? Is it to be a historian, a curator, a keeper of the flame? I say, absolutely not. Culture never disappears, no matter the circumstances. We must seek it out and let it flourish, whatever the costs. Culture is not always in the museum (before they became homages to state politics), but it will not die and it is for us to be with it.
A Felt Mountain;//;//;//;I frickin love Unleashed's new song, what a trip. I love the whole psychedelic, laidback feel. Harmonically, it's super interesting. The way those first two chords move from the SubDominant to the Tonic is you know, fairly established, but so effective. The rhythms in common time meter are flexible and spacey. Can't wait to see what he does next.;NO POST TODAY;Adrian/Blantano's Delta is like if Elliott Smith wrote Karma Police. Like a lot of us, he's been using that Cimbalon machine to get those chimey 'Third Man' sounds. An awesome, moody piece of writing with a Lennonish vocal.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Buried Pleasures;//;//;//;//;NO POST TODAY;Pretty happy with a song I wrote for an artist here. Used the drum machine, you might recognise the sound. Something like 67 bpm.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
Chuck & Steven;//;//;//;//;Outdated tech. Who doesn't love it? We'll be discussing vinyl, CDs, VHS, The Commodore 64, all the good stuff! Although pretty much all contraband now, you can find a good selection on the black market in the German quarter, where we have been know to run a stall.;Now in our overview of outdated technologies we come to CDs. CDs were pretty pricey and not as good as vinyl, but you could do some nifty things with them. For example, you could make it so the track started a little later than zero and so you could rewind for a secret track. Great use of technology!;Betamax was perhaps the technology that never was. Although superior in many ways to VHS, they simply couldn't corner the market. Proof, if it were ever needed, that convenience trumps quality.;Seems like our posts have outlasted most of the board. Oh well, let's see how long we can keep this going shall we. This week, it's time for the great grandaddy of them all, ham radio. Ham has become in recent years the main go to day-to-day communication device for scofflaws such as ourselves. We use it to keep up with brethren in their own regimes across the world. Truly an old dog that learnt new tricks, Ham has proved invaluable where closed computer networks are not possible.
Unleashed Collier;//;//;//;//;//;So here's something interesting, the first two chords of my song are actually the day and month of my birthday (in that order). Funny how the universe turns.;NO POST TODAY;NO POST TODAY
12 Tone Moan;//;//;//;//;//;A lot of us actually live pretty close to each other in the French Quarter. I often see Rick and Felt going to their work together. It's a pretty cosy community of illegals, nere' do wells and general flagrant disregarders.;Can't wait to hear it Cuckoo! I hope you sing sweetly.;Heya Future, that's because Schoenberg didn't invent it, he just built on it. Best.
Cornell's Kernels;//;//;//;//;//;Favorite Romantic Era Composers : Satie, Ravel, Chopin, Beethoven, Brahms. Nuff Said.;Hi Babybell, yes I do! Comes in useful all the time! Especially on leap, leap, leap years.;NO POST TODAY
Mealy Adam;//;//;//;//;//;You ever tried 16/17 time signature? What a great meter! Sure beats common 4/4.;Nice one Cuckoosong, stick it up for everyone and I'll be sure to give you compliments (and a harmonic analysis!);Been listening to ThinkTank, by Blur. Great secret track before track one, check it out.
The Shit Parade;//;//;//;//;//;Hey SGTT, you into Angel Olsen?;Hey guys I've got something to say. Coming soon.;Ye know, it makes me sick how SGTT is being treated. She's totally in love with Sunburnt (and never stops to say it), but he is totally on one with Babybell. Sorry I had to be the one to say it but respect is so important.
Slick Rick;//;//;//;//;//;Call me an old guy, but I say there's no HAIM without Fleetwood Mac, no Lorde without Kate Bush. You guys are all into that mid-2000s stuff, but I say go deeper! I mean, just look at the production - cocaine, booze and 8 tracks, what more could you ask for!;Today I wanted to talk about the 'Mu' chord. Associated with Steely Dan, it's a major chord with an added 9. It's got a bright sparkly sound you can hear on all sorts of things all the way to the Smiths. The 9th in the 2000s also started to become a strong note to lead a chorus with. You can even hear it on our chamelon-par-excellence Ella Nella's new track.;NO POST TODAY
