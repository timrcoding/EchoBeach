Ella Nella;Happy Birthday Grey! You mine is just a month after?7;What makes a great song? Hooks, Melody, Timing, but most of all philosophy. A song has to mean something or else it's nothing at all.;//;//;//;//;//;//
Wronguns;Music aside, there's a takeaway at the end of my road that's started doing curry with chips AND rice AND crisps. Got napkins and everything. Proper!;Tried some proper Rooibos tea for the first at Elvis's yesterday. Very tasty. I must come round Studebaker Mansions more often!;Thankyou Lady Jane for introducing me to falafel! Honestly, I wasn't sure at first, but I tried it with some chilli sauce and it was proper smashing. Parking was a job though.;//;Anyone heard from Grey, I owe him a pint for writing a verse on my new song. It's going to be called, pot of gold and it's about snooker. I mean honestly, are things really that bad?;//;Ah shit, had a bad week. First I've heard that Adrian's been nabbed and then my favorite chip show has closed down. Can't get much worse than that.;//
FuturePerfect;I'd love a mentor, someone to teach me. There seems to be some great older mentors with students on the web - Elvis & BabyBell, Rick and Felt, even Curt and Adrian. I think I'd learn so much from and old fashioned master apprenticeship.7;So here's a question, if all the schools are teaching is how to be a citizen, what sort of basis do my students have in history, politics, economics? It's just plain dogma.;I've been getting a lot of lip from my students recently, who want to know why the power keeps getting turned off. Obviously nothing I can do, Grey, what do you do in your classroom when there's trouble?;My missus in the Primary school has been teaching the kids the fixed curriculum on productivity. Honestly, half of them fell asleep and the other half started smashing things. This obsession is what got us here in the first place.;//;Not sure what I'm going to do. Apparently I'm meant to start teaching the anti-arts programme, aka Personal Responsibility and Development. Makes me a little sick and I'm sure you understand. Anyway, I'm going to have to do it without drawing any attention to myself. Maybe I can sneak in an Aerosmith record as an example of degrading behaviour. Or maybe not.;//;//
DaveyMoon;Recently I've been listening a lot to Ella Nella's new work. Honestly, I do think she's the most sensational pop musician - voice, writing, everything. We've been talking about doing a collaboration. I've got this drum machine that's been doing the rounds - the one with the fixed tempo, you know it. I think it would be perfect for something more mid-tempo for Ella to screeeam over.;//;//;//;//;//;//;//
Lady Jane (Elsie Bristol);A good stage name, that's the key for me. I've never used my own name (sorry all Janes out there), unlike my friend Davey. To me, a stage name is like an identity that you can throw on whenever it suits you. In real life I'm not that confident, but Lady Jane can step out in front of all you boys and girls and let 'em have it.;//;I've always been pretty proud of my roots, in fact my surname is the largest city in my county. I think because of that I've always had a strong connection to my location and I try to write about it as much as possible. People call be Hazelnut because of my hair, not much to say about that.7;I've been living alone since my brother was called up to the Navy. Seems like every young man is guarding the perimeter, waiting for something to happen. I'm here wondering when things are going to start changing. All that keeps me going is this board and people on it. I hope you know how much it means to me.;//;//;//;//
Smoking Elvis;Copying is a big thing for me, I can't see the point. I always used to disagree with Gwilym over how he'd write songs with same title's as his favorite artists. I'd say, you're not Neil Young, why not do something else. I think he found it a good springboard for creativity.5;I've been living with my girlfriend for like six months now. We're really enjoyin it, despite the clouds of black ash that rain down every night from the cement factories. Lots of music, lots of dope, lots of pirated Dustin Hoffman films, fuck the censors! Anyway, she's been thinking of taking in this stray cat we've seen around the neighbourhood. Thing only has three legs, what do you think? I mean, is it me, do you think? Do I look like a Cat lover to you?;Hey guys, some stuff has come up which you might not know about. Something pretty shocking, I can't talk about it in case it endangers anyone here, but I'm going to be taking sometime off the board. I don't know how it happened, but I hope you're all safe. Elvis.;//;//;//;//;//
Simple Simon;Wanted to take a moment to tell you about my dear friend Davey Moon. Davey is a super lad, who at the age of four was so prodigious on the Ukulele, he was taken to see the Lord Mayor. I've played with Davey ((nee. Pritchard) for a number of years on different projects and I can say he's an ace on guitar, bass and drums. Top Bloke!;So this week it's my turn to explain what is so so great about Ella Nella. This is a girl with PIPES, I'm talking blow your house down Shirley Bassey tools here. She seems totally great and Elvis is super lucky. What a power couple.;When I'm able to drag myself away from the piano, I'm always drawn to the writing of Danzig. You know, there's very few writers on here who make me think quite as hard as him. Honestly, I know some people think him a bit austere, but he's got it covered.;//;//;//;//;//
Boyfriend Sweater;Hey Elsie (aka Hazelnut), give me buzz, I need to chat with you about how incredible you are!5;//;Squad, squad, squad, squad. I need my squad. It would be so great to meet some of you in real life. Perhaps we can organise something under cover of darkness?;//;//;//;//;//
Sad Girl Tik Tok;//;//;//;"Yeah, I dunno. I think mentioning an ex-partner by name is a pretty bold more. I'm not sure I'd do it, but hey, what a song! ""Roads on the County Lines"".";;//;//;Secret Track - Hey Charlie, how you doing? Know I love you.
Grey Gardner;//;//;//;//;//;//;//;//
Blantano;//;//;Record Review: Delta by Adrian is a lovely, seventies style ballad, which draws to mind both acts like Colin Bluntstone (The Zombies) and Elliott Smith. It's lush orchestration complements Adrian's Lennonish double tracking. A really cool bit of classic pop craftsmanship.;//;Record Review: River by Lady Jane. Ever the versatile bedroom producer (as we all are now), Lady Jane fashions a stylish rhythm section from sticks, claps and a drum machine. Her electro-acoustic approach manages to sound precise yet organic at the same time, cool like the Ice floats, but warm like the sun.;//;//;//
BabyBell;//;//;//;//;Poll: Best Neil Young Album and Year: Smoking Elvis, After The Goldrush, 1970, Blantano, Trans, 1982. Adrian - 1992, you know the record.;//;//;//
Girlfriend Smirlfriend;//;//;//;Name a song after me, the sheer nerve. You think it was a nothing crush, I sure didn't!;//;//;//;//
Sunburnt County;//;//;//;//;o I wrote and recorded this song, although it's under a friend's name. I wanted to talk about some snowy, romantic escapade (and a lost coat).8;//;I sometimes go down the French quarter to see the road signs. They're all named after famous French composers, which is crazy all things considered. I don't think the powers that be realise there's still music about so they don't bother changing them to street q1a or the like. Feels good.;Secret Track - Hello missy, I named this song after you (Caroline)
VileyCurt;//;//;//;No wonder he's so obsessed with all things lunar, he's a literal astrophysicist!;//;//;//;
Adrian (Gwilym);//;//;//;You've always got to be careful with talking about people's romantic partners on the site. I've certainly found it awkward in the past, but hey, art is art and you need to discuss it! I'm sure that Smirlfriend wishes Boyfriend Sweater all the best, even if they're not together anymore.;//;//;//;//
Oodles of Poodles;//;//;//;"So I've got a new article on the Arctic Monkeys and the retro revolution of 2005. I can't stick it all here (DM me), but here's an excerpt. ""Despite his scrawny frame and yowling singing voice, Alex Turner possessed a quick and subtle lyrical wit akin to Ray Davies of the Kinks or Chris Difford of Squeeze. He seemed to draw a straight line back to the disaffected popular singers of the 60s, from Roger Daltrey to Scott Walker...";You know I try to write about where I'm from, but you know, New Dulwich is pretty boring. I wish I could talk about London the way Lady Jane talks about Avon.;A bit more from my article. Jack White of The White Stripes was perhaps the last frontman of a major rock group who managed to cultivate any significant mystique around himself. Divorced from the rich boy gravitas of Julian Casablancas, or the hillbilly posturing of Kings of Leon, White presented a figure utterly inscrutable. There was no clear distinction where performance and artist began or ended. In this sense, his closest musical forebear appeared to be Nick Cave, another progressive bluesman of sorts.;//;Looks like this party may be coming to an end. Here's one last bit. I was very young when I experienced the music I write about it and it has left and indelible mark on me. Looking back has always been a way to look forward, but in these times I wonder if it is all we have left. Alex, Jack, Franz, and all those other good looking bastards.
Danzig Ostrifier;//;//;//;I'm a writer, but I feel like I am more than that.;//;Music journalism is one thing, but I've always found it strange that people don't consider you a musician. Lester Bangs was one! Sort of. Nothing I like more than sitting down with my chord machine and working out other people's songs.;//;What is the role of cultural journalism in a time when culture is banned? Is it to be a historian, a curator, a keeper of the flame? I say, absolutely not. Culture never disappears, no matter the circumstances. We must seek it out and let it flourish, whatever the costs. Culture is not always in the museum (before they became homages to state politics), but it will not die and it is for us to be with it.
A Felt Mountain;//;//;//;I frickin love Unleashed's new song, what a trip. I love the whole psychedelic, laidback feel. Harmonically, it's super interesting. The way those first two chords move from the SubDominant to the Tonic is you know, fairly established, but so effective. Can't wait to see what he does next.6;//;//;//;//
Buried Pleasures;//;//;//;//;//;So I used the broken drum machine with the fixed tempo to write a song for an artist on here. Pretty sure he kept the same tempo when recorded. Stuck the name of my road in the American quarter for good measure. God I miss being able to travel!;//;//
Chuck & Steven;//;//;//;//;Outdated tech. Who doesn't love it? We'll be discussing vinyl, CDs, VHS, The Commodore 64, all the good stuff! Although pretty much all contraband now, you can find a good selection on the black market in the German quarter, where we have been know to run a stall.;Now in our overview of outdated technologies we come to CDs. CDs were pretty pricey and not as good as vinyl, but you could do some nifty things with them. For example, you could make it so the track started a little later than zero and so you could rewind for a secret track. Great use of technology!8;Betamax was perhaps the technology that never was. Although superior in many ways to VHS, they simply couldn't corner the market. Proof, if it were ever needed, that convenience trumps quality.;Seems like our posts have outlasted most of the board. Oh well, let's see how long we can keep this going shall we. This week, it's time for the great grandaddy of them all, ham radio. Ham has become in recent years the main go to day-to-day communication device for scofflaws such as ourselves. We use it to keep up with brethren in their own regimes across the world. Truly an old dog that learnt new tricks, Ham has proved invaluable where closed computer networks are not possible.
Unleashed Collier;//;//;//;//;//;So here's something interesting, the first two chords of Mealy's song are actually the day and month of my birthday (in that order). Funny how the universe turns.;//;//
12 Tone Moan;//;//;//;//;//;(TASK 7) A lot of us actually live pretty close to each other in the French Quarter. I often see Rick and Felt going to their work together. It's a pretty cosy community of illegals, nere' do wells and general flagrant disregarders.;//;//
Cornell's Kernels;//;//;//;//;//;Favorite Romantic Era Composers : Satie, Ravel, Chopin, Beethoven, Brahms. Nuff Said.7;//;//
Mealy Adam;//;//;//;//;//;//;//;Been listening to ThinkTank, by Blur. Great secret track before track one, check it out.
The Shit Parade;//;//;//;//;//;//;//;Ye know, it makes me sick how SGTT is being treated. She's totally in love with Sunburnt (and never stops to say it), but he is totally on one with Babybell. Sorry I had to be the one to say it but respect is so important.
Slick Rick;//;//;//;//;//;Today I'm listening to some serious jazz music. None of that Steely Dan stuff, I'm talking John, Elvis, Miles, the whole shebang.;//;//
