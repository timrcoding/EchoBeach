      Hi Future, I hope you''re well.
      I was wondering if I could ask you something? It''s a bit personal.'

      Lately, I''ve been finding it
      really hard to reconcile my life here to my real life, if you know what I mean.


      In
      here is so exciting, but as soon as I step away, it''s like a constant disappointment.


      You
      know?'

      SURE. I GET IT.


      EVERYONE''S
      GOT LIVES AND WE''RE DOING SOMETHING SOCIETY DOESN''T VALUE.


      IT CAN
      BE HARD SOMETIMES TO FEEL LIKE YOU''RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. EVEN THOUGH YOU
      KNOW YOU ARE.'

      PEOPLE DO IT BECAUSE IT'S ALL THEY CAN DO. \n\nFOR ME IT'S MORE ABOUT HAVING
      SOMETHING NOBODY ELSE CAN OWN.\n\nMAYBE JUST SPEND A LITTLE TIME THINKING ABOUT
      WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO YOU."
