  BodyText: "\n\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures
    which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. \r\n\r\nThe voice
    came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the
    surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat,
    though the words were still distinguishable. \r\n\r\nThe instrument (the telescreen,
    it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely.
    He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his
    body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the Party.
    \r\n\r\nHis hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened
    by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just
    ended."
